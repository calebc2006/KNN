# KNN

KNN.py is the actual algorithm
Basically it works by finding euclidean (straight line) distance to each AP and using an inverse square relationship (change ORDER variable to change to linear/inverse cube etc). Would be interesting to figure out which order works best but it would be most in line with physics/reality if it were an inverse square relation.

KNN_data.py is where you insert your data

KNN_errors.csv is where the output is written (open in excel to plot graph if you don't like the look of matplotlib graphs)
